# Remove tourist from images

## Description

This program was created in September 2017 as part of my university coursework.

Imagine that you are returning from a wonderful vacation and you see that all your
photos have a person on them walking through the frame.

This program is a median filter that uses Python and Pillow and 9 images provided
to create a new image that does not include the annoying tourist. 
The median filter takes the pixel channel values at each coordinate and calculates the median.
All pictures have the same size, so the new image that we create will have this size.
